I think a remote cloud disk can reserve them in a better way. This is only a start. I will send more resources on the github to make the daily notes stantard.\r\n# About\r\nI'm a Chinese, not a native English speaker. So my writing may have some grammar and wording faults. After all, this is an attempt. If there is anything you wanna to deliver to me, please send a email at [phpcyy@163.com](mailto:phpcyy@163.com).",
